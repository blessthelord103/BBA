13273,ESTH,7,7,And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.,,,,,,13273,17
13274,ESTH,7,8,"Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was.

13276,ESTH,7,10,So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.,,,,,,13276,17
13277,ESTH,8,1,On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.,,,,,,13277,17
