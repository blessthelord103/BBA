21986,DANI,1,10,"And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.",,,,,,21986,27
21987,DANI,1,11,"Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,",,,,,,21987,27

21990,DANI,1,14,"So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.",,,,,,21990,27
21991,DANI,1,15,And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.,,,,,,21991,27
21992,DANI,1,16,"Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.",,,,,,21992,27
21993,DANI,1,17,"As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.",,,,,,21993,27

22006,DANI,2,9,"But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.",,,,,,22006,27
22007,DANI,2,10,"The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.",,,,,,22007,27
22008,DANI,2,11,"And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.",,,,,,22008,27

22012,DANI,2,15,"He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.",,,,,,22012,27
22013,DANI,2,16,"Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.",,,,,,22013,27
22014,DANI,2,17,"Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:",,,,,,22014,27

22022,DANI,2,25,"Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.",,,,,,22022,27
22023,DANI,2,26,"The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?",,,,,,22023,27
