6944,JOSH,6,21,"And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.",,,,,,6944,6

6950,JOSH,6,27,So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.,,,,,,6950,6

6964,JOSH,7,14,"In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.",,,,,,6964,6

8310,"1SAM",13,5,"And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.",,,,,,8310,9
8311,"1SAM",13,6,"When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.",,,,,,8311,9
8312,"1SAM",13,7,"And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.",,,,,,8312,9
8313,"1SAM",13,8,"And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.",,,,,,8313,9
8314,"1SAM",13,9,"And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.",,,,,,8314,9
8315,"1SAM",13,10,"And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him.",,,,,,8315,9
8316,"1SAM",13,11,"And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;",,,,,,8316,9
8317,"1SAM",13,12,"Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.",,,,,,8317,9
8318,"1SAM",13,13,"And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.",,,,,,8318,9
8319,"1SAM",13,14,"But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.",,,,,,8319,9
8320,"1SAM",13,15,"And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.",,,,,,8320,9
8321,"1SAM",13,16,"And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.",,,,,,8321,9
8322,"1SAM",13,17,"And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:",,,,,,8322,9
8323,"1SAM",13,18,And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.,,,,,,8323,9
8324,"1SAM",13,19,"Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:",,,,,,8324,9
8325,"1SAM",13,20,"But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.",,,,,,8325,9
8326,"1SAM",13,21,"Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.",,,,,,8326,9
8327,"1SAM",13,22,"So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.",,,,,,8327,9
8328,"1SAM",13,23,And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.,,,,,,8328,9
8329,"1SAM",14,1,"Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.",,,,,,8329,9
8330,"1SAM",14,2,And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;,,,,,,8330,9
8331,"1SAM",14,3,"And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.",,,,,,8331,9
8332,"1SAM",14,4,"And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.",,,,,,8332,9
8333,"1SAM",14,5,"The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.",,,,,,8333,9
8334,"1SAM",14,6,"And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.",,,,,,8334,9
8335,"1SAM",14,7,"And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.",,,,,,8335,9
8336,"1SAM",14,8,"Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.",,,,,,8336,9
8337,"1SAM",14,9,"If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.",,,,,,8337,9
8338,"1SAM",14,10,"But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.",,,,,,8338,9
8339,"1SAM",14,11,"And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.",,,,,,8339,9
8340,"1SAM",14,12,"And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.",,,,,,8340,9
8341,"1SAM",14,13,"And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.",,,,,,8341,9
8342,"1SAM",14,14,"And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.",,,,,,8342,9
8343,"1SAM",14,15,"And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.",,,,,,8343,9
8344,"1SAM",14,16,"And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.",,,,,,8344,9
8345,"1SAM",14,17,"Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.",,,,,,8345,9
8346,"1SAM",14,18,"And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.",,,,,,8346,9
8347,"1SAM",14,19,"And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.",,,,,,8347,9
8348,"1SAM",14,20,"And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.",,,,,,8348,9
8349,"1SAM",14,21,"Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.",,,,,,8349,9
8350,"1SAM",14,22,"Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.",,,,,,8350,9
8351,"1SAM",14,23,So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven.,,,,,,8351,9
8352,"1SAM",14,24,"And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.",,,,,,8352,9
8353,"1SAM",14,25,And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.,,,,,,8353,9
8354,"1SAM",14,26,"And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.",,,,,,8354,9
8355,"1SAM",14,27,"But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.",,,,,,8355,9
8356,"1SAM",14,28,"Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.",,,,,,8356,9
8357,"1SAM",14,29,"Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.",,,,,,8357,9
8358,"1SAM",14,30,"How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?",,,,,,8358,9
8359,"1SAM",14,31,And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.,,,,,,8359,9
8360,"1SAM",14,32,"And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.",,,,,,8360,9
8361,"1SAM",14,33,"Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.",,,,,,8361,9
8362,"1SAM",14,34,"And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.",,,,,,8362,9
8363,"1SAM",14,35,And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.,,,,,,8363,9
8364,"1SAM",14,36,"And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.",,,,,,8364,9
8365,"1SAM",14,37,"And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.",,,,,,8365,9
8366,"1SAM",14,38,"And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.",,,,,,8366,9
8367,"1SAM",14,39,"For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.",,,,,,8367,9
8368,"1SAM",14,40,"Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.",,,,,,8368,9
8369,"1SAM",14,41,"Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.",,,,,,8369,9
8370,"1SAM",14,42,"And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.",,,,,,8370,9
8371,"1SAM",14,43,"Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.",,,,,,8371,9
8372,"1SAM",14,44,"And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.",,,,,,8372,9
8373,"1SAM",14,45,"And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.",,,,,,8373,9
8374,"1SAM",14,46,Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.,,,,,,8374,9
8375,"1SAM",14,47,"So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.",,,,,,8375,9
8376,"1SAM",14,48,"And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.",,,,,,8376,9
8377,"1SAM",14,49,"Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:",,,,,,8377,9
8378,"1SAM",14,50,"And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.",,,,,,8378,9
8379,"1SAM",14,51,And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.,,,,,,8379,9
8380,"1SAM",14,52,"And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.",,,,,,8380,9
8381,"1SAM",15,1,"Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.",,,,,,8381,9
8382,"1SAM",15,2,"Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.",,,,,,8382,9
8383,"1SAM",15,3,"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.",,,,,,8383,9
8384,"1SAM",15,4,"And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.",,,,,,8384,9
8385,"1SAM",15,5,"And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.",,,,,,8385,9
8386,"1SAM",15,6,"And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.",,,,,,8386,9
8387,"1SAM",15,7,"And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.",,,,,,8387,9
8388,"1SAM",15,8,"And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.",,,,,,8388,9
8389,"1SAM",15,9,"But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.",,,,,,8389,9
8390,"1SAM",15,10,"Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,",,,,,,8390,9
8391,"1SAM",15,11,"It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.",,,,,,8391,9
8392,"1SAM",15,12,"And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.",,,,,,8392,9
8393,"1SAM",15,13,"And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.",,,,,,8393,9
8394,"1SAM",15,14,"And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?",,,,,,8394,9
8395,"1SAM",15,15,"And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.",,,,,,8395,9
8396,"1SAM",15,16,"Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.",,,,,,8396,9
8397,"1SAM",15,17,"And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?",,,,,,8397,9
8398,"1SAM",15,18,"And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.",,,,,,8398,9
8399,"1SAM",15,19,"Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?",,,,,,8399,9
8400,"1SAM",15,20,"And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.",,,,,,8400,9
8401,"1SAM",15,21,"But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.",,,,,,8401,9
8402,"1SAM",15,22,"And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.",,,,,,8402,9
8403,"1SAM",15,23,"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.",,,,,,8403,9
8404,"1SAM",15,24,"And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.",,,,,,8404,9
8405,"1SAM",15,25,"Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.",,,,,,8405,9
8406,"1SAM",15,26,"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.",,,,,,8406,9
8407,"1SAM",15,27,"And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.",,,,,,8407,9
8408,"1SAM",15,28,"And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine, that is better than thou.",,,,,,8408,9
8409,"1SAM",15,29,"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.",,,,,,8409,9
8410,"1SAM",15,30,"Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.",,,,,,8410,9
8411,"1SAM",15,31,So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.,,,,,,8411,9
8412,"1SAM",15,32,"Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.",,,,,,8412,9
8413,"1SAM",15,33,"And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.",,,,,,8413,9
8414,"1SAM",15,34,Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.,,,,,,8414,9
8415,"1SAM",15,35,And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.,,,,,,8415,9
8416,"1SAM",16,1,"And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.",,,,,,8416,9
8417,"1SAM",16,2,"And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.",,,,,,8417,9
8418,"1SAM",16,3,"And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.",,,,,,8418,9
8419,"1SAM",16,4,"And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?",,,,,,8419,9
8420,"1SAM",16,5,"And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.",,,,,,8420,9
8421,"1SAM",16,6,"And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.",,,,,,8421,9
8422,"1SAM",16,7,"But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.",,,,,,8422,9
8423,"1SAM",16,8,"Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.",,,,,,8423,9
8424,"1SAM",16,9,"Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.",,,,,,8424,9
8425,"1SAM",16,10,"Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.",,,,,,8425,9
8426,"1SAM",16,11,"And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.",,,,,,8426,9
8427,"1SAM",16,12,"And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.",,,,,,8427,9
8428,"1SAM",16,13,"Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.",,,,,,8428,9
8429,"1SAM",16,14,"But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.",,,,,,8429,9
8430,"1SAM",16,15,"And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.",,,,,,8430,9
8431,"1SAM",16,16,"Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.",,,,,,8431,9
8432,"1SAM",16,17,"And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.",,,,,,8432,9
8433,"1SAM",16,18,"Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.",,,,,,8433,9
8434,"1SAM",16,19,"Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sheep.",,,,,,8434,9

8752,"1SAM",27,2,"And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.",,,,,,8752,9

9198,"2SAM",14,22,"And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.",,,,,,9198,10
9199,"2SAM",14,23,"So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.",,,,,,9199,10
9200,"2SAM",14,24,"And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.",,,,,,9200,10
9201,"2SAM",14,25,But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.,,,,,,9201,10
9202,"2SAM",14,26,"And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.",,,,,,9202,10
9203,"2SAM",14,27,"And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.",,,,,,9203,10
9204,"2SAM",14,28,"So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.",,,,,,9204,10
9205,"2SAM",14,29,"Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.",,,,,,9205,10
9206,"2SAM",14,30,"Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.",,,,,,9206,10
9207,"2SAM",14,31,"Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?",,,,,,9207,10
9208,"2SAM",14,32,"And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.",,,,,,9208,10
9209,"2SAM",14,33,"So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.",,,,,,9209,10
9210,"2SAM",15,1,"And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.",,,,,,9210,10
9211,"2SAM",15,2,"And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.",,,,,,9211,10
9212,"2SAM",15,3,"And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.",,,,,,9212,10
9213,"2SAM",15,4,"Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!",,,,,,9213,10
9214,"2SAM",15,5,"And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.",,,,,,9214,10
9215,"2SAM",15,6,And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.,,,,,,9215,10
9216,"2SAM",15,7,"And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.",,,,,,9216,10
9217,"2SAM",15,8,"For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.",,,,,,9217,10
9218,"2SAM",15,9,"And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.",,,,,,9218,10
9219,"2SAM",15,10,"But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.",,,,,,9219,10
9220,"2SAM",15,11,"And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.",,,,,,9220,10
9221,"2SAM",15,12,"And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.",,,,,,9221,10
9222,"2SAM",15,13,"And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.",,,,,,9222,10
9223,"2SAM",15,14,"And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.",,,,,,9223,10
9224,"2SAM",15,15,"And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.",,,,,,9224,10
9225,"2SAM",15,16,"And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.",,,,,,9225,10
9226,"2SAM",15,17,"And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.",,,,,,9226,10
9227,"2SAM",15,18,"And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.",,,,,,9227,10
9228,"2SAM",15,19,"Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.",,,,,,9228,10
9229,"2SAM",18,5,"And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.",,,,,,9229,10
9230,"2SAM",18,6,So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;,,,,,,9230,10
9231,"2SAM",18,7,"Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.",,,,,,9231,10
9232,"2SAM",18,8,For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.,,,,,,9232,10
9233,"2SAM",18,9,"And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.",,,,,,9233,10
9234,"2SAM",18,10,"And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.",,,,,,9234,10
9235,"2SAM",18,11,"And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.",,,,,,9235,10
9236,"2SAM",18,12,"And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.",,,,,,9236,10
9237,"2SAM",18,13,"Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.",,,,,,9237,10
9238,"2SAM",18,14,"Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.",,,,,,9238,10
9239,"2SAM",18,15,"And ten young men that bare Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.",,,,,,9239,10
9240,"2SAM",18,16,"And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.",,,,,,9240,10
9241,"2SAM",18,17,"And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.",,,,,,9241,10
9242,"2SAM",18,18,"Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.",,,,,,9242,10
9243,"2SAM",18,19,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.",,,,,,9243,10
9244,"2SAM",18,20,"And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.",,,,,,9244,10
9245,"2SAM",18,21,"Then said Joab to Cushy, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushy bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.",,,,,,9245,10
9246,"2SAM",18,22,"Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushy. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?",,,,,,9246,10
9247,"2SAM",18,23,"But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushy.",,,,,,9247,10
9248,"2SAM",18,24,"And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.",,,,,,9248,10
9249,"2SAM",18,25,"And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.",,,,,,9249,10
9250,"2SAM",18,26,"And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.",,,,,,9250,10
9251,"2SAM",18,27,"And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.",,,,,,9251,10
9252,"2SAM",18,28,"And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.",,,,,,9252,10
9253,"2SAM",18,29,"And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.",,,,,,9253,10
9254,"2SAM",18,30,"And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.",,,,,,9254,10
9255,"2SAM",18,31,"And, behold, Cushy came; and Cushy said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.",,,,,,9255,10
9256,"2SAM",18,32,"And the king said unto Cushy, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushy answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.",,,,,,9256,10
9257,"2SAM",18,33,"And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!",,,,,,9257,10
9258,"2SAM",19,1,"And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.",,,,,,9258,10
9259,"2SAM",19,2,And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.,,,,,,9259,10
9260,"2SAM",19,3,"And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.",,,,,,9260,10
9261,"2SAM",19,4,"But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!",,,,,,9261,10
9262,"2SAM",19,5,"And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;",,,,,,9262,10
9263,"2SAM",19,6,"In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.",,,,,,9263,10
9264,"2SAM",19,7,"Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.",,,,,,9264,10
9265,"2SAM",19,8,"Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.",,,,,,9265,10
9266,"2SAM",19,9,"And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.",,,,,,9266,10
9267,"2SAM",19,10,"And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?",,,,,,9267,10
9268,"2SAM",19,11,"And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.",,,,,,9268,10
9269,"2SAM",19,12,"Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?",,,,,,9269,10

9271,"2SAM",19,14,"And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.",,,,,,9271,10
9272,"2SAM",19,15,"So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.",,,,,,9272,10
9273,"2SAM",19,16,"And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.",,,,,,9273,10

9277,"2SAM",19,20,"For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.",,,,,,9277,10
9278,"2SAM",19,21,"But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed?",,,,,,9278,10

9280,"2SAM",19,23,"Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.",,,,,,9280,10

9282,"2SAM",19,25,"And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?",,,,,,9282,10
9283,"2SAM",19,26,"And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.",,,,,,9283,10
9284,"2SAM",19,27,And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.,,,,,,9284,10
9285,"2SAM",19,28,For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?,,,,,,9285,10
9286,"2SAM",19,29,"And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.",,,,,,9286,10

9292,"2SAM",19,35,I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?,,,,,,9292,10
9293,"2SAM",19,36,Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?,,,,,,9293,10
9294,"2SAM",19,37,"Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.",,,,,,9294,10

9297,"2SAM",19,40,"Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.",,,,,,9297,10
9298,"2SAM",19,41,"And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?",,,,,,9298,10
9299,"2SAM",19,42,"And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?",,,,,,9299,10
